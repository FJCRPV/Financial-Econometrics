# Financial Econometrics

Projects developed in light of the course.

The goal of this project was to create a Python version of the PSY Monitor R library from itamarcaspi, which can be found in the following repository: [PSY Monitor](https://github.com/itamarcaspi/psymonitor).

### Library summary

Psymonitor provides an accessible implementation of the popular real-time monitoring strategy proposed by Phillips, Shi and Yu (2015a,b;PSY), along with a new bootstrap procedure designed to mitigate the potential impact of heteroskedasticity and to effect family-wise size control in recursive testing algorithms (Phillips and Shi, forthcoming). This methodology has been shown effective for bubble and crisis detection (PSY, 2015a,b; Phillips and Shi, 2017) and is now widely used by academic researchers, central bank economists, and fiscal regulators.
